# Dev Lead Assessment

As an individual in a Dev Lead capacity at NinjaOne, you'll be responsible for both, providing guidance in the implementation and design of technical solutions, and managing the individual teams and projects.

With this in mind, the exercise simulates the common lifecycle of a project and your role in the design, implementation and management of it. 

## Directions

1. Visit the [Backend Engineer Task for NinjaOne](https://github.com/NinjaRMM/backend-interview-project-app-template/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md) to view the Project and familiarize yourself with the requirements. NOTE: ***You do not have to follow the assessment instructions to implement/code the solution***
1. Based on the Requirements, create a text document with the following: 

    1. User Stories modeling the implementation of the project that would be ultimately assigned to Developers
    1. Design and document the Data Model using either a Diagram, a text document, or SQL DDL statements. Please include relationships between the Entities and the data types of their fields
    1. The design of the request / response interfaces for the endpoints in the service
    1. The Infrastructure Architecture either using text or diagram with the system parts required to run the service. This can be modeled as running in any type of infrastructure environment whether on-prem, VMs, Containers, cloud native, or any sort of hybrid environment

1. After the document is completed, consider the following to discuss on the subsequent video call: 

    * The implementation and design choices of the project and be ready to discuss them verbally
    * Identify independent parts of the project that can be delivered to production, providing immediate value without waiting for other parts
    * Points in the requirements and design that should be addressed with Product Management

Send back all the documentation required to your point of contact and we will subsequently review and schedule a panel video call to discuss the submitted items and additional questions regarding your plan of execution for the Project.
