# Dev Lead Assessment

As an individual in a Dev Lead capacity at NinjaOne, you'll be responsible for both, providing guidance in the implementation and design of technical solutions, and managing the individual teams and projects.

With this in mind, the exercise simulates the common lifecycle of a project and your role in the design, implementation and management of it. 

## Directions

1. Visit the [Backend Engineer Task for NinjaOne](https://github.com/NinjaRMM/backend-interview-project-app-template/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md) to view the Project and familiarize yourself with the requirements
3. Based on the Requirements, Create User Stories modeling the implementation of the project that would be ultimately assigned to Developers. The stories can just be written in a text document, no need to put them into a board in a Project Management platform
4. Design and Document the Data Model using either a Diagram, a text document, or SQL DDL statements
5. Consider implementation and design choices of the project and be ready to discuss them verbally
6. Identify independent parts of the project that can be delivered to production, providing immediate value without waiting for other parts
7. Consider points in the requiremens and design that should be addressed with Product Management

Send back all the documentation to your point of contact and we will subsequently schedule a panel video call to discuss the submitted items and additional questions regarding your plan of execution for the Project.
